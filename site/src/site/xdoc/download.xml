      <p>Apache Oltu is distributed in several formats for your convenience. Use a source archive if you intend to build
   Apache Oltu yourself. Otherwise, simply pick a ready-made binary distribution and follow the installation
   instructions given inside the archives.</p>

      <source><a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/oltu/">http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/oltu/</a></source>

      <p>You will be prompted for a mirror - if the file is not found on yours, please be patient, as it may take 24
   hours to reach all mirrors.</p>

      <p>In order to guard against corrupted downloads/installations, it is highly recommended to
   <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#verifying-signature">verify the signature</a>
   of the release bundles against the public <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/oltu/KEYS">KEYS</a> used by the Apache Oltu
   developers.</p>

      <p>As there are many artifacts for Oltu, <b>users are encouraged to include Oltu as a Maven dependency</b>. 
   A list of Oltu Maven artifacts can be found <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|org.apache.oltu">here</a></p>
